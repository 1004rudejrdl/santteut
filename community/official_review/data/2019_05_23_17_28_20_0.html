  <!--Ultimately, creative code should be embraced as a form of critical digital making,
  affirming writing code as an important part of critical thinking in 21st-century art education.

  Computational thinking and the writing of code is not just a technical practice
  implementing mathematical algorithms, but rather a process of design, an act of
  free speech, and a digital production method.

  While we believe maker and art education groups have common interests, critical thinking
  in the art education curriculum is vital to critical digital making and important to all disciplines
  prioritizing computational thinking.

  A 2013 exchange in Art Education displayed a visible divide between
  art educators and maker movement advocates wondering "if traditional
  arts and maker-based educational initiatives can work synergistically"
  (Clapp & Jimenez, 2013, p. 5) for 21st-century arts learning.

  By contrast, we advocate for working with creative code and electronics
  in schools as new materials for art exploration and critical reflection.

  Critical digital making engages sociocultural meaning of performative programmable
  objects complicating our perception and making of those objects.

  Current learning models have captured a do-it-yourself ethos toward technology , encouraging
  ad hoc learning communities of new media artists in hackerspaces, makerspaces, and online makerspacesoutside of schools
  (Peppler, 2013).

  Thinking as Making: Looping Back to Critical Digital Makers

  We have argued teaching computational thinking in the art classroom allows students the opportunity
  to create programmable objects as art projects invested in critical Thinkingand material play.

  Modes of making as an iterative design process have been prominent in the
  research areas of constructionism, computational thinking, and studio thinking.

  Code is Performed and Acted Upon as Digital Material

  While we agree with creative code advocates like John Maeda (2004) and Kylie
  Peppler and Yasmin Kafai (2005) that code is an important new material
  for creative expression, our embrace of computational thinking for art education
  forefronts meaning-making through a critical digital making process.

  Resistance to creative code and methods of critical digital making in art education
  is is partially driven by perceiving a material absence and digital works
  lacking an aura (Benjamin, Jennings, Doherty, Levin, &Jephcott, 2008).

  This resistance is rooted in a material bias or cynicism: the notion that
  the physical touch of the artist's hand is more authentic and impactful for
  learning and experience (Lu,2005). Even Papert's imaginative future for making
  in mathematics was inspired by the very real substance of soap, a carving knife,
  and two hands put to work. So what drives the resistance to digital artmaking?
  What is the nature of materiality if material exploration is a core value of
  Papert's constructionist approach to learning? Digital materiality is intertwined
  with software, user interfaces, and the code paradigms connecting them, each explicitly
  playing a part of the material of the digital computing era, without tangible surface
  quality. However, materiality can be defined by its properties to do something,
  or What scholar Andrew Pickering(1995) called "material performativity" (p. 7).
  The digital materiality of software is not tangible matter but, rather, its agency
  in interactivity making up code's material character:
